`:mockery_macro` is a small support package that extracts the `Mockery.Macro` macros from the main `:mockery` library. It provides the macros needed to prepare modules for mocking without pulling in the full `:mockery` runtime. For installation, usage examples and full documentation, see the main `Mockery` repository and docs:
